Gameplay Overview
In this game, you control the player character represented by B on a 20x20 grid. The objective is to avoid or defeat the enemy character, represented by &, which actively moves towards you. You can move in four directions and shoot bullets upwards to try and eliminate the enemy.

Enemy Behavior
The enemy character & is designed to move towards your position each turn, attempting to reach and defeat you. Currently, the enemy is overpowered, making the game quite challenging. This imbalance is acknowledged and will be addressed in future commits to provide a more balanced and enjoyable gaming experience.
